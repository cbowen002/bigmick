# Chelsea Owens Big Mick Project

## Overview

This project is based off the restaurant in the 1988 motion picture, Coming to America. McDowell's is a close competitor with McDonald's as well as home of the Big Mick (Two all beef patties, special sauce, lettuce, cheese, pickles and onions on a seed free bun!) This is one of my favorite movies and what better way to pay homage with my first coding project. 

This website includes functioning home, mick deal, staff, and contact us pages.
